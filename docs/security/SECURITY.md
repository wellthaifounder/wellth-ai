## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never Commit Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Verify .env is gitignored
   git status

   # Should NOT show .env
   ```

2. **Always Validate Inputs**
   ```typescript
   import { z } from 'zod';

   const schema = z.object({
     email: z.string().email().max(255),
     amount: z.number().positive()
   });

   const data = schema.parse(userInput);
   ```

3. **Use Error Sanitization**
   ```typescript
   import { handleError } from '@/utils/errorHandler';

   try {
     await riskyOperation();
   } catch (error) {
     handleError(error, 'operation-context', toast);
   }
   ```

4. **Verify User Ownership**
   ```typescript
   const { data } = await supabase
     .from('expenses')
     .select('*')
     .eq('user_id', user.id); // Explicit check
   ```

5. **No PHI in Logs**
   ```typescript
   // Bad
   console.log('User email:', email);

   // Good
   import { logError } from '@/utils/errorHandler';
   logError('Operation failed', error, { context: 'specific-operation' });
   ```

### For Users

1. **Use Strong Passwords**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Use a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden)

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication** (when available)

3. **Review Connected Accounts**
   - Regularly review bank account connections
   - Revoke unused integrations

4. **Report Suspicious Activity**
   - Email security@wellth.ai immediately
   - Include details of suspicious behavior
