FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'insurance_plan';

-- Verify analytics_events table exists
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name = 'analytics_events';

-- View your insurance plan
SELECT insurance_plan FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
