                          There were three ways to create an expense:
                          /bills/new ran a five-step upload wizard,
                          "Add manually" on the expense list opened a dialog
                          that wrote a *transaction* instead of an expense,
                          and /expenses/new wrote the expense directly. Three
                          buttons, three different records, no way for the
                          person clicking to know which they were getting.

                          /expenses/new survives because it is the only one
                          that asks for the things an audit needs — patient
                          from the family roster, date of service separate
                          from date of payment — and the only one that can
                          record mileage, which has no transaction at all. It
                          absorbed the wizard's receipt scanning, so nothing
                          the wizard did is lost.

                          Both old URLs redirect: /bills/new was linked from
                          eight places in the app and from onboarding email. */}
