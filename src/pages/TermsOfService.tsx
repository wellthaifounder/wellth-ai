              These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of
              Reclaim's web and mobile applications (the "Service"). By creating
              an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
              Terms and by our{" "}

            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">2. What Reclaim Is</h2>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Reclaim helps you identify healthcare expenses that may be
              eligible for reimbursement from a Health Savings Account (HSA),
              organize supporting documentation, and generate Medical Expense
              Records. Reclaim is a recordkeeping and organizational tool. It is{" "}
              <strong>
                not a tax advisor, financial advisor, accountant, HSA custodian,
                or healthcare provider
              </strong>
              , and nothing in the Service constitutes tax, legal, financial, or
              medical advice.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              <strong>The Service supports HSA distributions only.</strong> It
              is not built for, and must not be used to substantiate, claims
              against a health Flexible Spending Account (FSA), a Health
              Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), or any other employer-sponsored
              plan. Those plans require the plan administrator to substantiate
              every claim through an independent third party, and a record you
              assemble yourself cannot satisfy that requirement.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              You must be at least 18 years old and able to form a binding
              contract to use the Service. You are responsible for the accuracy
              of the information you provide, for maintaining the
              confidentiality of your credentials, and for all activity that
              occurs under your account. Notify us immediately of any
              unauthorized use.

              Eligibility determinations, IRS Publication 502 classifications,
              and Medical Expense Records produced by the Service are estimates
              and aids, not guarantees. Tax rules change and apply differently
              to each person. You are solely responsible for confirming that an
              expense qualifies, for the timing and substantiation of any HSA
              distribution you take, and for your own tax filings. Consult a
              qualified professional before acting. You assume all
              responsibility for reimbursements you choose to make.

              Paid tiers are billed in advance on a recurring basis through
              Stripe and renew automatically until cancelled. You may cancel at
              any time; cancellation takes effect at the end of the current
