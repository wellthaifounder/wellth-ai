// Reclaim Phase 4 W1+W2 — Medical Expense Record list + generation flow.
//
// The document was titled "Substantiation Record" until 2026-09-06. See
// drawCover in lib/substantiationRecord.ts for the reasoning; the table, the
// module and the RCM-YYYY-NNNN record number all keep their old names.
//
// Two views in one page:
//   - "list": prior records + a hero CTA showing how many ELIGIBLE expenses
//     are ready to bundle, with the dollar total. This is where the user
//     comes after the brief §8 dashboard's "READY TO SUBMIT" bucket
//     (Phase 5 will surface this prominently from the home screen).
//   - "generate": pick which ELIGIBLE expenses to include + format(s),
//     generate client-side, download, and mark the underlying invoices
//     SUBMITTED.
//
// Workstream E1: this is now the ONLY way to build a reimbursement claim. The
// legacy path (/hsa-reimbursement and the ledger's Claim HSA dialog) is gone,
// and those surfaces hand their selection here through router state instead.
// That mattered for more than tidiness: the old flow marked expenses
// 'reimbursed' the instant the PDF downloaded, before the custodian had seen
// the claim. This one locks them and waits for the deposit.
//
// SUBMITTED transition (the W2 piece):
//   - On successful generation, every included invoice gets
//     lifecycle_status='submitted', submitted_at=now(), submitted_record_id
//     set to the new record's id. The first record an invoice lands in
//     "owns" the back-link; subsequent records can reference the same
//     invoice via substantiation_record_items but won't overwrite the
//     submitted_record_id. This is intentional — if the user generates
//     two records covering the same expense, the FIRST one is treated as
//     canonical for the lifecycle.
