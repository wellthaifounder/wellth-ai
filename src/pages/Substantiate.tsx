// Reclaim Phase 5 W2 — Substantiate: step two of Categorize → Substantiate →
// Reimburse.
//
// Step two had no home. The two halves of substantiating an expense lived on
// pages that did not know about each other: attaching a document happened in
// SubstantiateDialog (reachable only from the expense list), and confirming
// eligibility happened on /review, which no nav had linked to since Phase 5 W1.
// A user who wanted to do both did it in two places, or never found the second
// one. This page is the single destination for both, and the nav points at it.
//
// **The queue is lifecycle_status, not a re-derivation.** `needs_receipt` and
// `pending_review` are precisely the two states that mean "this expense needs
// step two", and the column is maintained by trg_invoices_sync_lifecycle from
// the three facets. Re-deriving readiness here from receipts + eligibility
// would be a second opinion that drifts from the trigger's. Query the column.
//
// Two actions per row, both without leaving the page:
//
//   - **Attach a document** — SubstantiateDialog (upload / photo / OCR) or
//     AttachDocumentDialog (reuse a file already on file), unchanged. They are
//     deliberately not wizards: substantiation is resumable by nature, so
//     every field saves on its own. Do not redesign them into a flow.
//   - **Confirm eligible / ineligible** — moved verbatim from /review's act().
//     confirmed_at is the audit-trail moat: Medical Expense Records cite that
//     timestamp as the user's explicit eligibility-determination event, so it
//     is stamped ONLY for a real determination, never for a deferral.
//
// Writes go to the facets (eligibility_state / documentation_state), never to
// lifecycle_status — that column is derived and direct writes are overwritten.
//
// **Why a row can stay after you confirm it.** The trigger maps
// `eligibility_state = 'eligible' AND documentation_state = 'none'` to
// needs_receipt, so confirming an expense that has no document leaves it in
// this queue — correctly: it still needs a receipt. So this page refetches and
// lets lifecycle_status decide what stays, rather than optimistically dropping
// the row the way /review did. /review could drop it because confirming was
// the only thing it offered; here, a row that stays with "Confirmed eligible —
// still needs a document" is the honest answer and tells the user what is left.

/**
 * The lifecycle states that mean "step two is not done yet".
 *
 * `captured` joined them on 2026-09-06, when confirming a transaction as
 * medical became the thing that creates its expense. A brand-new expense has
 * eligibility 'unknown' and documentation 'none', which the lifecycle trigger
 * maps to `captured` — no document, no eligibility decision, which is the
 * definition of needing step two.
 *
 * It was excluded before for a reason that no longer holds: expenses used to be
 * created by the sync without anyone approving them, so `captured` was a pile
 * of the app's own guesses and would have buried the real queue. An expense now
 * exists only because the user approved it, so every one of them belongs here.
 * Leaving it out was what made six confirmed expenses worth $2,642.13 land in a
 * queue that said "you're all caught up".
