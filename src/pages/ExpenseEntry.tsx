// Manual entry — Workstream D6.
//
// Not an escape hatch. The spec is explicit that bank sync structurally cannot
// see medical mileage, cash payments or certain premiums, so this surface is a
// peer of the sync path rather than a fallback from it. Two modes:
//
//   A payment — something you paid for that your bank did not record.
//   Driving   — the per-mile claim, which has no dollar transaction at all.
//
// Both create an Expense directly, skipping Step 1 (categorize) exactly as the
// spec calls for.
//
// Lightweight no-file-required entry path for users whose expense doesn't
// fit the BillUploadWizard (no receipt, cash purchase, retroactive entry)
// or whose savings-calculator decision needs to be tied to a real expense.
//
// Inserts into `invoices` with `lifecycle_status = 'captured'` and the
// IRS-required patient, selected from the family roster (Workstream D1),
// matching the wizard's data model so downstream Phase 3 classification + Phase 4 Substantiation-Record output
// don't care which surface created the row.
//
// 2026-08-21: this is now the ONLY way to create an expense by hand. It
// absorbed the receipt scanning from the five-step wizard that used to live at
// /bills/new — attach a photo and it reads the provider, amount and date off
// it and offers them, which is what the wizard's first three steps did. It
// offers, it does not fill: OCR is a guess about someone's medical paperwork,
// and the spec is explicit that a guess never overwrites silently.
//
// What this is NOT:
//   - An edit form (Phase 5 BillDetail handles edits)
//   - The previous pre-Reclaim version that lived here (700 LOC of
//     payment-plan / reimbursement-strategy / HSA-date wiring; replaced
//     wholesale because it was orphaned, used a stale category list, set
//     no lifecycle/patient fields, and navigated to a non-existent route
//     on success).
