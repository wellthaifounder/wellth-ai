// Reclaim — 4-tab mobile bottom navigation.
//
// Follows the spec's spine in order: Transactions is where money gets sorted
// into medical / non-medical, Expenses is what came out of that, and Reimburse
// is where a reimbursement packet gets built. Expense Groups was retired on
// 2026-08-20 with the rest of the care-events surface, and Transactions took
// the free slot — it is step one of the workflow and had been buried behind
// "More".
//
// Labelled "Reimburse," not "Records" or "Substantiation" -- this tab is the
// third step of Categorize -> Substantiate -> Reimburse, not the second. See
// design review Phase 5 correction, 2026-09-04.
//
// The remaining surfaces (Documents, Bank Accounts) live behind the sidebar's
// "More" group on desktop and the hamburger sheet on mobile.
